        <p>1. What’s the podcast about?</p>
        <ul class="options">
            <li>a. Direct versus indirect communication styles and how you should master both.</li>
            <li>b. High-context and low-context cultures and what this means.</li>
            <li>c. Differences in communication between individualistic and collectivistic cultures.</li>
            <li data-correct="true">d. How to categorize different cultures so we can communicate better across cultures.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question" id="q2">
        <p>2. What is a key difference between indirect communication and direct communication?</p>
        <ul class="options">
            <li>a. In an indirect communication style speakers tend to have more communication breakdowns since they don’t share all their thoughts, while in a direct communication style these communication breakdowns are minimized.</li>
            <li data-correct="true">b. In an indirect communication style the speakers don’t need to explain certain things since they are common knowledge, while a direct communication style specifies each piece of information.</li>
            <li>c. In an indirect communication style the speakers don’t really express how they feel, while in a direct communication style people tend to focus on sharing their negative emotions.</li>
            <li>d. In an indirect communication style people speak to help other achieve a common goal, while in a direct communication style people don’t pay attention to common goals.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question" id="q3">
        <p>3. What is a key difference between a low-context culture and a high-context culture in communication?</p>
        <ul class="options">
            <li>a. Low-context cultures rely on the surrounding environment and shared background knowledge when expressing messages.</li>
            <li>b. Low-context cultures prioritize the needs of the whole group.</li>
            <li data-correct="true">c. Low-context cultures don’t have a lot of shared context, so a lot of focus is put on the actual words being said.</li>
            <li>d. Low-context cultures are linked to individualistic cultures.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question" id="q4">
        <p>4. What is an example of a breakdown between an indirect and a direct communicator?</p>
        <ul class="options">
            <li>a. The indirect communicator may give too many details to explain his or her position, while the direct communicator doesn’t communicate using so much explanation.</li>
            <li>b. The indirect communicator may not consider the direct communicator’s feelings enough.</li>
            <li>c. The indirect and direct communicators may argue with each other if they have different opinions.</li>
            <li data-correct="true">d. An indirect communicator may not give enough details, assuming the direct communicator already knows the background of the situation.</li>
        </ul>
